    content: `>From a theoretical perspective, the emergence of [weird machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_machine) becomes clear when one considers software as a way to restrict the number of reachable states and state transitions of a computer: The general-purpose CPU is, through software, specialized to simulate a finite-state machine (with potentially very large state space). Many states the CPU could be in are excluded, and certain state transitions are ruled out - for example those that violate the software's security requirements. When the system is somehow moved into a state that "makes no sense" when viewed from the perspective of the intended finite-state machine (through memory corruption, hardware failure, or other programming mistakes), the software will keep transforming the broken state into new broken states, triggered by further user input. A new computational device arises: The weird machine which can reach different states of the CPU than the programmer anticipated, and which does so in reaction to inputs.

[PJ](pj@reciprocal.ltd) gave a talk on the subject [here](https://civ.rip/d/wm/).`,
