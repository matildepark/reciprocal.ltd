                </a> is an Electron-based desktop environment for Urbit ships and applications, developed and maintained by the Tirrel Corporation.</p>
            <p>Besides the obvious 'overlapping window' functionality, it also allows users to search and install applications,
                providing an alternative to the default Grid experience provided by the Tlon Corporation.</p>
            <p>Reciprocal created the minimum viable product and continues to provide additional maintenance and features.</p>
